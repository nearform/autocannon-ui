This monorepo contains packages and applications which provide a GUI for using autocannon while maintaining the same user experience. 
It provides the ability to compare two autocannon results.

To compare, the user must tick two results and press the `Compare` button. The popup that appeared will display the comparing result.
For understanding the result, please see the `autocannon-compare` [documentation](https://github.com/mcollina/autocannon-compare).
