# autocannon-compare-cli

A simple tool to compare autocannon results, alternative to [autocannon-compare](https://github.com/mcollina/autocannon-compare) but aims to provide a slightly more readable output for the terminal using a table and colors.

#### Usage

> autocannon-compare-cli -a ./path-to-file-a.json -b ./path-to-file-b.json
